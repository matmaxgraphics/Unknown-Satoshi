                    <p>The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for
                        anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared.
                        It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had
                        removed them was a question that had been asked time and again,
                        but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes
                        remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another</p>
                    <p>I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk,
                        vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks
                        and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It's better with both kinds. It comes out pretty
                        bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows --
                        what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and
                        then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things
                        in moderation, friends. All things in moderation.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes it's just better not to be seen. That's how Harry had always lived his life. He prided
                        himself as being the fly on the wall and the fae that blended into the crowd. That's why he was
                        so shocked that she noticed him.</p>
                    <p>It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the
                        knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the
                        same time.
                        You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know
                        what to do next</p>
                    <p>
                        She asked the question even though she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win
                        situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she'd get confirmation of her worst
                        fears. If he lied, she'd know that he wasn't who she
                        thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for
                        his answer.</p>
